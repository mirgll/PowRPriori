Description: Conduct a priori power analyses via Monte-Carlo style data simulation for linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs/GLMMs). 
    Provides a user-friendly workflow with helper functions to easily fixed and random effects as well as diagnostic functions
    to evaluate the adequacy of the results of the power analysis.
